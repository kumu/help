## Getting Started

Run `make setup` to install the required gems and set up pow link.

## Adding New Content

Run `make preview` and get to work. All source files are under `site/` with previews generated to `_site/`. Visit `help.kumu.dev` to preview your changes.

Make sure you're not working directly on the `gh-pages` branch. Either work on `master` or create a feature branch.

## Releasing Updates

Merge your changes into the `gh-pages` branch and push it.  In the future we may want to do these through pull requests.
