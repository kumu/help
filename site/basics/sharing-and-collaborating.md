Kumu is built to be collaborative whether you have a public or private project. Add people to your project through the main menu or using the dropdown in the upper left of the map overview.

## Inviting other users

Enter the username of the person you want to collaborate with and then choose whether that person should be an observer, collaborator, or manager. You can search by name, username, or email, but the person you are inviting needs to have a Kumu username before you can add them.

### Observers
Observers have view-only access to your entire project. Adding observers is great when you want people to have secure access to your project but they don't need to add or edit any content.

### Collaborators
Collaborators are the work horses of your project and can do pretty much everything except adding and managing the roles of other people on the project.

### Managers
Managers can add and remove people from the project and can also change the roles of current users.

## Public Projects

Public projects allow you to easily share and build upon the work of the whole Kumu community. For more information, view the [public projects guide](/guides/public-projects.html).

## Presentations

Presentations combine the best of PowerPoint, Prezi, and Kumu into one easy-to-use tool. You'll find presentations in the main menu of your project. Here's a quick guide to getting started:

## Embeds

Embeds make it easy to include an interactive, read-only version of your map on a blog or wesbite. Click the share button in the upper right corner of your map and then create the embed. Learn more about embeds [here](/guides/embeds.html).
