Kumu is built to be collaborative whether you have a public or private project. Add people to your project through the menu menu or using the dropdown in the upper left of the map overview.

Enter the user's email and then choose whether the user should be an observer, collaborator, or manager.

<dl>
<dt>Observers</dt>
<dd>Observers have view-only access to your entire project. Adding observers is great when you want people to have secure access to your project but they don't need to add or edit any content.</dd>

<dt>Collaborators</dt>
<dd>Collaborators are the work horses of your project and can do pretty much everything except adding and managing the roles of other people on the project.</dd>

<dt>Managers</dt>
<dd>Managers can add and remove people from the project and can also change the roles of current users.</dd>

## Public Accounts

Public accounts allow you to easily share and build upon the work of the whole Kumu community. For more information, view the [public accounts guide](/guides/public-accounts.html).
