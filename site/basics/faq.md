### Why does my map keep moving?

Kumu has a custom layout engine which creates a high quality layout regardless of map size. If you'd rather not have the layout change after you are happy with it, select all elements using the ***a*** keystroke and then click the pin button in the toolbar.

### Is there a limit to how many collaborators I can have in an account?

No, every Kumu account comes with unlimited collaborators (except for our Enterprise version).
