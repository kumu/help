We give you a number of different ways to build your map. The best method will vary based on the type of map you're creating and your preference to work more with your mouse or your keyboard. If you already have existing data you're looking to import, [jump to the imports section](/basics/imports.html).

## Using the add buttons

Adding an element is as simple as clicking the blue "Add Element" button in the upper left of the map. Type the name of the element you want to add and then hit enter.

To add a connection, select the element you want to connect from and then click the "Add Connection" button. Type the name of the element you want to connect to and then hit enter. If the element you are trying to connect to doesn't exist yet, Kumu will create the element for you first and then create the connection to it.

## Using keyboard shortcuts

You can also add an element by hitting the "e" key on your keyboard, typing the name of the element, and then hitting enter. The shortcut for adding connections is the "c" key.

## Alt + click to add elements

To add elements to the map and have them pinned by default, hold alt and then click on the map where you'd like the element to be placed. You'll be prompted to add a label and then the element will be created, pinned in the place you clicked. When building a system map, this is usually the best method for creating your map.

## Alt + drag to connect

You can use alt + drag to connect two elements that already exist. Hold alt and then click and drag from one element to another. Let go when your cursor is hovering over the element you wish to connect to.

You can also add a new element and connect to it using this method by holding alt and then clicking and dragging to a blank part of the map. When you release, a new element will be created in that spot with a connection to it. The new element will inherit the pin state of the existing element (if the element you are connecting from is pinned, the new element will be pinned and vice versa).
