Attributes add incredible power to Kumu. You can track as many attributes as needed and customize the type of attribute to allow for checklists, prompts, currencies, and much more. You account starts without any attributes so you can create just the ones that you need.

## Add an attribute
To add an attribute, select an element or connection and then click the "Create Your First Attribute" or "+ New Attribute" button in the sidebar. You'll be prompted to add a name and a value for the attribute.

By default, new attributes are set to accept only one value and not prompt users with suggested values. While this is an easy way to get started adding values, you may have times where you want people to pick from a list of defined values (level of influence: high, medium or low) or multiple values from a list (skills: project management, web development, leadership, public speaking).

## Customize an attribute
To customize the settings for a given attribute, hover over the label of the attribute. You'll see a wrench icon (<i class="fa fa-wrench"></i>) that you can click to bring up the attribute settings. On this page you can change:

* **Name**
* **Limit** - one value **OR** one or more values
* **Format** - none, text/markdown, URL, number, percentage, currency, date
* **Prompt** - none, autocomplete, list
* **Category** - for grouping attributes in sections
* **Label** - if the displayed name of the attribute should be different than the name



Let's look at a few of these options in more depth:

### Attribute format
Below are the choices for the attribute format and guidance on when to use each:

* **None** - This is the default value and used when entering simple short pieces of text
* **Text/Markdown** - Used for longer text fields like notes, addresses, and anywhere you want to use markdown formatting
* **URL** - Used for website addresses
* **Number** - Used for numerical values that don't fit into the below categories
* **Percentages** -  Used for percentages (of course!)
* **Currency** - Used for any money-based value
* **Date** - Used to enter dates (enter the date in any format you'd like)

### Attribute prompt
Below are the choices for the attribute prompt and guidance on when to use each:

* **None** - Use when you'd like to turn off any prompts for attribute values
* **Autocomplete** - Use when you'd like a tag-like interface for prompting values that match the current input
* **List** - Use when you want to pick from a list of defined values

### Attribute category
By default, all attributes are ordered alphabetically based on the name of the attribute. You can also group attributes by assigning them a category. For example, you may want to have all financial information (FY 2012 Investment, FY 2013 Investment and Cumulative Investment) under the category "Financials". You can create multiple categories and each will be ordered alphabetically.

We reserve a few category names that we give special treatment to:

* **General** - This is the default. Attributes in this category will live at the top of the attribute section and won't have an explicit category label.
* **Footnotes** - This category is meant for things like attribution and citing your sources. Attributes in this category will always be listed at the bottom of the profile.

## Attribute relevance
You can also manage attribute relevance through the project's settings to prevent irrelevant attributes getting in the way of your work. Navigate to the main menu of your project and then click on the settings tab (<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>). You'll be presented with a text input for each of the types currently present in your map.

By default, all attributes are shown for all types. If you'd like to limit the attributes that are shown, simply type the name of each attribute you'd like to appear in the profile for a given type. Label, type, and description are always shown for all types regardless of what you enter. Above is an example of customizing the profile of elements with type of "People" to only show Phone, Address, and Skills.
