We've built Kumu to be both simple **and** powerful. While you'll be able to browse and create maps without much guidance, there is a lot of depth to Kumu's features that you'll want to explore. We'll start with a quick overview of Kumu's layout:

![layout overview](/images/getting-started-overview.png)

## The sidebar

The left side of your screen is the sidebar. The sidebar's contents change based on what is selected on the map and which actions you are completing. When you select any element, connection or loop, the sidebar shows the profile for the given entity. You can quickly deselect the entity and return to the map overview by clicking on the "X" in the upper right corner of the profile.

If at any point you'd like to hide the sidebar so you can have a full screen view of your map, simply click the three vertical dots (<i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i>) off to the middle right side of the sidebar.


## The map
The right side of your screen is the map. Elements are the circles you see on the map and connections are the lines between the elements. To select either of them, simply click on the circle or the line. When you do this, you'll see the sidebar change to the profile for the given entity.

In the lower right corner of the map you'll find a cloud icon (<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>) that can be used to import data to your account. You can also drag and drop files directly onto your map to import them. [Click here to learn more about imports.](/basics/imports.html)

## The toolbar
At the bottom of the map you'll find the toolbar. Use the toolbar to pin elements in place, add direction to connections, and much more. Head on over to the [the toolbar guide](/guides/the-toolbar.html) for more details.

You can also use the toolbar to access the main menu  where you can easily switch between maps, perspectives, and also edit project settings. Make sure to learn the ***tab*** keystroke to open the main menu as you'll be using it a lot.
