We've built Kumu to be both simple **and** powerful. While you'll be able to browse and create maps without much guidance, there is a lot of depth to Kumu's features that you'll want to explore.

We'll start with a quick overview of Kumu's layout.

## The sidebar

The left side of your screen is the sidebar. The sidebar's contents change based on what is selected on the map and which actions you are completing. Here are some of the main views:

### The map overview
When you first open a map (and when you don't have anything selected on the map) the sidebar shows you the map overview. Each map has a description which can be edited by clicking in the text area. We recommend including a general overview of what you are mapping to give anyone viewing your map quick context.

You can use the upper left menu to manage attributes, members, and settings. You can also click to learn about the project or switch between different projects.

### Element and connection profiles

When you select any element, connection or loop, the sidebar shows the profile for the given entity. You can quickly deselect the entity and return to the map overview by clicking on the "X" in the upper right corner of the profile.

### Hiding the sidebar

If at any point you'd like to hide the sidebar so you can have a full screen view of your map, simply click the three vertical dots (<i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i>) off to the middle right side of the sidebar. This will collapse the sidebar. Click in the same spot to expand the sidebar once it has been collapsed.


## The map
The right side of your screen is the map. Elements are the circles you see on the map and connections are the lines between the elements. To select either of them, simply click on the circle or the line. When you do this, you'll see the sidebar change to the profile for the given entity.

In the upper left corner of the map you'll find a search bar along with buttons to add both elements and connections.

In the upper right corner of the map you'll find buttons to:

* Zoom in (<i class="fa fa-plus"></i>) and out (<i class="fa fa-minus"></i>)
* Change the zoom to fit the entire map in the current viewport (<i class="fa fa-compress"></i>)
* Refresh the layout (<i class="fa fa-refresh"></i>)
* Take a screenshot of the map (<i class="fa fa-camera-retro"></i>)
* Create and manage embeds of your map (<i class="fa fa-code"></i>)

In the lower right corner of the map you'll find a cloud icon (<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>) that can be used to import data to your account. You can also drag and drop files directly onto your map to import them. [Click here to learn more about imports.](/basics/imports.html)


## The toolbar
At the bottom of the map you'll find the toolbar. With the toolbar you can:

* Access the main menu (<i class="fa fa-th"></i>)
* Pin elements in place so they don't float (<i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i>)
* Change the direction of connections (or add/remove the arrow) (<i class="fa fa-random"></i>)
* Add delays to connections (<i class="fa fa-warning"></i>)
* Delete entities (<i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i>)
* Cluster
* Decorate (<i class="fa fa-tint"></i>)
* Filter (<i class="fa fa-filter"></i>)
* Focus (<i class="fa fa-crosshairs"></i>)
* Access additional settings (<i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h"></i>)

The main menu serves as a quick way to switch between maps, perspectives, and also edit project settings. In addition to clicking on the icon in the toolbar, you can also access it by hitting ***spacebar*** on your computer.
