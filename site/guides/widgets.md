We've built a [flexible widget framework](https://github.com/kumu/widgets) to make it easy to embed your favorite content within Kumu. Widgets are curently supported for:

* YouTube
* Vimeo
* Slideshare
* Speaker Deck

The basic format is:

```
[[widget/:id "descriptive title"]]
```

## Vimeo

It's now easier than ever to embed a Vimeo video in the profile.

```
[[vimeo/36519586 "a story for tomorrow by gnarly bay"]]
```

```

## Speaker Deck

```
[[speakerdeck/39d28e80a7840130b36006a0b9603b35 "The product is the byproduct"]]
```
