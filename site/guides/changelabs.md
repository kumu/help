## About ChangeLabs
Todayâ€™s global challenges demand collaborations that cut across silos, organizations, and geographies. Current business-as-usual approaches and behaviors continue to undercut economic growth, make poverty traps more entrenched, continue to erode food security, and further prolong existing social inequities.

At Stanford ChangeLabs, we believe that there are ways to create win-win strategies, frame transformative initiatives, and establish better business models in ways that address the scale, complexity and the urgency of these problems.

Stanford ChangeLabs is a network, a lab, and a global platform generating new paradigms to initiate rapid, large-scale change. Our goal it to quip global leaders and innovators with new frameworks, so they can engage in ill-defined complex issues, and prescribe actionable interventions that are designed for scaled impact.

## Getting Started

This guide provides instructions for using Kumu in the ChangeLabs process and Stanford's ENVRES 380 "Collaborating with the Future: Launching Large Scale Sustainable Transformations."" To follow these instructions, you'll need access to a project with the [ChangeLabs Project Blueprint](/images/kumu-changelabs-template.json) (if you don't have access to an existing project, download the blueprint file and import into a new, blank project). The ChangeLabs project blueprint is built off of our casual loop systems template but also predefines a number of maps, perspectives, and attribute settings not available in the standard template.

The ChangeLabs blueprint includes the following maps:

* Stakeholder ecosystem map
* Driving dynamics map

...with the following perspectives:

* Ecosystem analysis
* Dynamics analysis

### Driving dynamics

What are the driving dynamics for the results we are getting, both positive and negative? What is the key outcome? What phenomenom drive this outcome? Who are the stakeholders involved? Why?

This work is initially completed outside of Kumu on pre-supplied templates and handouts but provides the foundation for building the causal chain map within Kumu.

<p>Once completed, populate your narrative of the driving dynamics in the "Causal chain map" overview. Begin creating your driving dynamics map by adding a few outcomes and phenomena.</p>
</div>

### Stakeholder networks
Identify the **key stakeholders**, human or "institutional" actors in the context of your challenge. The key stakeholders are the ones that define overall behavior of the ecosystem and the ones that you as a designer are most interested in serving. Note that a stakeholder can be a non-human entity. As such, any non-static element (such as natural environment) that is an "actor" in the ecosystem can also be seen as a stakeholder. It's often useful to "anthropomorphize" a stakeholder so that they can lend themselves to "behavior analysis."

#### Identify and map the key stakeholders
Using the lists below, generate a list of "actors" with different ecosystem and diffusion roles. Choose the eight most important stakeholders and add them to your map. Connect them to each other to depict where there are existing relationships. The next step is to identify key secondary stakeholders. These are the ones that are salient in the context of your challenge and who are connected to the primary stakeholders in important ways.

**Ecosystem Roles:**

* Target Beneficiary
* Resource Producer
* Investor
* Policy/Law/Rule Maker
* Business/Industry
* Service Provider
* Government Agency
* Community Organizer
* Gatekeeper
* Resource controller
* Community
* Entrepreneur
* Technologist/Enabler

**Diffusion Roles:**

* Educator/Influencer
* Innovator
* Opinion Leader/Credible Source
* Maven & Trend Setter
* Network Hub/Information Broker
* Early Adopter
* Social/Community/Family/Friend Network
* Gatekeeper/Endorser/Validator/Evaluator
* Change Agent
* Storyteller/Media/Communicator
* Visionary
* Pollinator/Connector/Broker

#### Begin completing the persona profile for each stakeholder

Based on your ethnographic interviews, begin building the persona profile for each stakeholder by documenting:

* Key quotes (List some compelling quotes)
* Motivations (What are this stakeholders primary motivations? What drives it?)
* Pain points (What are some unment needs and goals?)
* Behavior patterns (What behaviors do we see recurring over time?)
* Mental models (What mental models are in use by this stakeholder?)
* Culture/norms (What are the culture/norms that drive this stakeholder's behavior?)
* Extrinsic constraints (What extrinsic constraints does this stakeholder face?)
* Names of interviewees (List the names of all the people you interviewed)
* Links to notes from interviewees (Link to a Google Doc of your interview notes)

## Week 2

### Stakeholder relationships and behaviors

#### Key relationships and 2-way analysis

Characterize the key relationships between stakeholders and look for opportunities for system transformation. For each relationship between stakeholders, document the:

* Value flows (Services, resources, beenfits, indirect benefits, etc.)
* Perceptions of the other stakeholder (How does this stakeholder perceive the other?)
* Desired action from the other stakeholder (What does this stakeholder want from the other stakeholder?)
* Power score (From 1-10, how much power/influence does a stakeholder have with respect to the other)

<div class="action-item" style="font-weight: bold">
<img src="/images/lightning-bolt.png" style="float: left; max-width: 100%; width: 60px; margin:0; padding-right: 10px; display: inline-block">
<p>Create connections between stakeholders for the key relationships that exist. For each relationship, fill in the value flows, perceptions, desired action and power score.</p>
</div>

### Driving dynamics mapping

With your driving dynamics map you are looking to identify the key issues and better understand why we are getting those outcomes. A great way to start this process is by using the "Key Issues" worksheet. Here's a simplified version of those questions:

**For each issue you identify**

1. Describe the issue
2. Do a root cause analysis
  * Why is this issue happeneing?
  * Why is ***that*** happening?
3. Describe a scenario when this issue plays out
4. Consider which stakeholders are involved
  * Who are the stakeholders?
  * How are they involved?
  * What do they care about most?
5. Look at linked issues
  * What other issues influence this issue?
  * What other issues are influenced by this issue?

The result of this process is a robust discussion around the key issues, how they are related, what outcomes are driving those issues, and early indications of what possible leverage points might be.

As you are connecting each of the phenomena, mark whether the connections are "same" or "opposite". Same connections are those where a change in one variable causes a similar change in the other (as civic engagement increases, quality of public policy increases) while opposite connections are those where a chaange in one variable causes and opposite change in the other (as the use of band-aid solutions increases, quality of public policy decreases).

<p>Begin building your driving dynamics map by taking the results of the key issues exercise and plotting those issues and connections on your map. Indicate whether each connection is same or opposite using "+" or "-" as the connection type.</p>

### Getting at the driving dynamics

Your map will initially feel quite complex and overwhelming. Since you are working to gather as much context and background as possible, that's completely fine (and expected). But as you proceed with your analysis, you'll want to start identifying and simplifying down to the key driving dynamics. Here are a few exercises/questions to guide you in that process:

* Study your current map and ask your team/stakeholders:
  * What resonates with you?
  * What do you have questions about?
  * What do you quarrel with?
  * What is missing?
* Based on your loops, interviews and map, what strikes you as prevealent (what factors do you see coming up again and again)?
* What strikes you as salient (you may not see it everywhere, but when you see it it's very powerful)?

Some signs you haven't gotten to the core driving dynamics:

* Your map looks more like something the cat threw up
* People quickly change the topic when you show your map to them

In all seriousness though, the goal of creating a system map is to move through a complex analysis and arrive at a simpler explanation of the critical elements driving the current outcomes. Your map should aid you in telling a story and framing the actions that need to be taken.

### Identifying leverage points

**Pre-reading: [Places to intervene in a system](http://www.donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/) by Donella Meadows**

You want to begin taking a more serious look at leverage points within your system. Donella's article provides a number of great clues as to what may provide more or less leverage in shifting a system. Here's a few others to guide you through that process:

* Where in the map are there factors that are currently in flux?
* Conversely, are there factors or regions of the map that are frozen?
* Are there spots where you are seeing a factor or causal relationship associated with two kinds of loops (one that is positively contributing to your desired outcomes and one that is negatively contributing)?
* Are there bright spots (areas you see positive deviance through stabilizing or virtuous loops) or attractors (loops with a strong impact/gravitational pull)?
* Which factors if changed have the higher potential for ripple effects?

Once you've identified possible leverage points, it's good to run through a few thought exercises:

* Explain the narrative story of how pushing on your leverage point will result in the desired outcome using your driving dynamics map.
* Use your stakeholder map to identify who might be supportive and who might be against whatever changes you recommend. Play out the possible resistance to find out what else you may need to include in your intervention.
* Ask yourself, what would happen if I pushed this leverage point in the exact opposite direction I think it should move?

<img src="/images/lightning-bolt.png" style="float: left; max-width: 100%; width: 60px; margin:0; padding-right: 10px; display: inline-block">
<p>Identify possible leverage points in your map and indicate the type of leverage while also adding your notes on why you feel that factor, connection or loop is a levarage point.</p>
</div>


### Stress-testing your map

It's helpful to have a few different frames for determining whether you've thought broadly enough with your analysis.

#### The SAT Model

The SAT model was created by Rob Ricigliano and is a way of categorizing all the types of factors that are present in a system. SAT stands for structural, attitudinal, and transactional. It's used by identifying whether each factor in your map is structural, attitudinal, or transactional and then making sure that you have a variety of each included in your map. If you're missing one or more categories entirely, it's a warning sign your analysis may not be sufficiently robust. Here's a definition of each category:

* **Structural:** The systems (e.g. rule of law, economy) and institutions designed to meet peopleâ€™s basic human needs
* **Attitudinal:** The attitudes, norms, and intergroup relationships that affect the level of cooperation between groups/people
* **Transactional:** Processes and skills used by key people to manage conflict, solve problems, and turn ideas into action

Each category of factor also changes according to a different time scale with transactional factors being the easiest/quickest to change, structural factors being far harder/slower/more expensive to change, and attitudinal factors being the hardest/slowest to change.

#### ChangeLabs Outcomes Model

Another great frame to use is ChangeLabs' outcome model. Are you looking at outcomes across all four dimensions and designing interventions that improve each?

* Economic
* Environmental
* Human
* Resilience
