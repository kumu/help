## About ChangeLabs
Todayâ€™s global challenges demand collaborations that cut across silos, organizations, and geographies. Current business-as-usual approaches and behaviors continue to undercut economic growth, make poverty traps more entrenched, continue to erode food security, and further prolong existing social inequities.

At Stanford ChangeLabs, we believe that there are ways to create win-win strategies, frame transformative initiatives, and establish better business models in ways that address the scale, complexity and the urgency of these problems.

Stanford ChangeLabs is a network, a lab, and a global platform generating new paradigms to initiate rapid, large-scale change. Our goal it to quip global leaders and innovators with new frameworks, so they can engage in ill-defined complex issues, and prescribe actionable interventions that are designed for scaled impact.

## Getting Started

This guide provides instructions for using Kumu in the ChangeLabs process and Stanford's ENVRES 380 "Collaborating with the Future: Launching Large Scale Sustainable Transformations."" To follow these instructions, you'll need access to a project with the [ChangeLabs Project Blueprint](/images/kumu-changelabs-template.json) (if you don't have access to an existing project, download the blueprint file and import into a new, blank project). The ChangeLabs project blueprint is built off of our casual loop systems template but also predefines a number of maps, perspectives, and attribute settings not available in the standard template.

The ChangeLabs blueprint includes the following maps:

* Stakeholder ecosystem map
* Driving dynamics map

...with the following perspectives:

* Ecosystem analysis
* Dynamics analysis

### Driving dynamics

What are the driving dynamics for the results we are getting, both positive and negative? What is the key outcome? What phenomenom drive this outcome? Who are the stakeholders involved? Why?

This work is initially completed outside of Kumu on pre-supplied templates and handouts but provides the foundation for building the causal chain map within Kumu.

<p>Once completed, populate your narrative of the driving dynamics in the "Causal chain map" overview. Begin creating your driving dynamics map by adding a few outcomes and phenomena.</p>
</div>

### Stakeholder networks
Identify the **key stakeholders**, human or "institutional" actors in the context of your challenge. The key stakeholders are the ones that define overall behavior of the ecosystem and the ones that you as a designer are most interested in serving. Note that a stakeholder can be a non-human entity. As such, any non-static element (such as natural environment) that is an "actor" in the ecosystem can also be seen as a stakeholder. It's often useful to "anthropomorphize" a stakeholder so that they can lend themselves to "behavior analysis."

#### Identify and map the key stakeholders
Using the lists below, generate a list of "actors" with different ecosystem and diffusion roles. Choose the eight most important stakeholders and add them to your map. Connect them to each other to depict where there are existing relationships. The next step is to identify key secondary stakeholders. These are the ones that are salient in the context of your challenge and who are connected to the primary stakeholders in important ways.

**Ecosystem Roles:**

* Target Beneficiary
* Resource Producer
* Investor
* Policy/Law/Rule Maker
* Business/Industry
* Service Provider
* Government Agency
* Community Organizer
* Gatekeeper
* Resource controller
* Community
* Entrepreneur
* Technologist/Enabler

**Diffusion Roles:**

* Educator/Influencer
* Innovator
* Opinion Leader/Credible Source
* Maven & Trend Setter
* Network Hub/Information Broker
* Early Adopter
* Social/Community/Family/Friend Network
* Gatekeeper/Endorser/Validator/Evaluator
* Change Agent
* Storyteller/Media/Communicator
* Visionary
* Pollinator/Connector/Broker

<p>Add the stakeholders to your ecosystem map and connect them to each other to depict where there are existing relationships.</p>
</div>

#### Begin completing the persona profile for each stakeholder

Based on your ethnographic interviews, begin building the persona profile for each stakeholder by documenting:

* Key quotes (List some compelling quotes)
* Motivations (What are this stakeholders primary motivations? What drives it?)
* Pain points (What are some unment needs and goals?)
* Behavior patterns (What behaviors do we see recurring over time?)
* Mental models (What mental models are in use by this stakeholder?)
* Culture/norms (What are the culture/norms that drive this stakeholder's behavior?)
* Extrinsic constraints (What extrinsic constraints does this stakeholder face?)
* Names of interviewees (List the names of all the people you interviewed)
* Links to notes from interviewees (Link to a Google Doc of your interview notes)

<img src="/images/lightning-bolt.png" style="float: left; max-width: 100%; width: 60px; margin:0; padding-right: 10px; display: inline-block">
<p>Fill out the profile for each stakeholder based on your ethnography. Add each person you interviewed to the map and connect him/her to the relevant stakeholder.</p>
</div>

## Week 2

### Stakeholder relationships and behaviors

#### Key relationships and 2 way analysis

Characterize the key relationships between stakeholders and look for opportunities for system transformation. For each relationship between stakeholders, document the:

* Value flows (Services, resources, beenfits, indirect benefits, etc.)
* Perceptions of the other stakeholder (How does this stakeholder perceive the other?)
* Desired action from the other stakeholder (What does this stakeholder want from the other stakeholder?)
* Power score (From 1-10, how much power/influence does a stakeholder have with respect to the other)

<div class="action-item" style="font-weight: bold">
<img src="/images/lightning-bolt.png" style="float: left; max-width: 100%; width: 60px; margin:0; padding-right: 10px; display: inline-block">
<p>Create connections between stakeholders for the key relationships that exist. For each relationship, fill in the value flows, perceptions, desired action and power score.</p>
</div>
