Clustering is an insanely powerful tool that allows you to transform profile information into a richly interactive map. It essentially creates an element for the data in the profile and draws a connection from any element that has that data.

## Choosing what to cluster by

First, make sure that you have information stored in the profiles of some of your elements that you want to virtualize. This could be an attribute like "Organization" that stores the company each person works for, or it may be other attributes like:

* Skills
* Region
* Sector

## Activating clusters

Once you have data that you want to cluster by, click on the cluster icon in the toolbar or use the "v" keystroke. This will open a pane in the sidebar that allows you to choose up to three items to virtualize.

Continuing with the "Organization" attribute example, let's say we choose "Organization" from the first drop down. Click the blue "Cluster" button and ***voila!*** You'll now see the organizations drawn as elements and connected to the people who work at each organization.

## Saving or switching clusters on the fly

You can choose to save the clustered elements and connections by clicking "Save Changes" or you can click reset so that you can experiment with other attributes to cluster. If you refresh the page, any unsaved clusters will be removed.
