Clustering is an insanely powerful tool that allows you to transform profile information into a richly interactive map. It essentially creates an element for the data in the profile and draws a connection from any element that has that data.

## A quick example

Most of the information you are working to map isn't stored in a format that is easily imported into Kumu. You probably have one Excel spreadsheet full of contacts, and one of the columns has the person's name and another column has the organization he or she works for. If you were to import this directly into Kumu, you'd end up with a map like this:

**Not that eye opening, right?** And if you wanted to see the relationship view, you would have to create a separate connections worksheet pointing each person to the organization they work for and then import both into Kumu. With clustering, **simply hit the v key** and you'll be prompted with a dropdown of what you want to cluster by. In this example, we'd choose **attributes** and then select the **organizations** attribute. Click cluster and *voila!* You now have a relational map of all the people and organizations without ever having to do the import workaround.

## Choosing what to cluster by

First, make sure that you have information stored in the profiles of some of your elements that you want to cluster. This could be an attribute like "Organization" that stores the company each person works for, or it may be other attributes like:

* Skills
* Region
* Sector

## Activating clusters

Once you have data that you want to cluster by, click on the cluster icon in the toolbar or use the "v" keystroke. This will open a pane in the sidebar that allows you to choose which items you want to cluster.

Continuing with the "Organization" attribute example, let's say we choose "Organization" from the first drop down. Click the blue "Cluster" button and ***voila!*** You'll now see the organizations drawn as elements and connected to the people who work at each organization.

## Saving or switching clusters on the fly

You can choose to save the clustered elements and connections by clicking the green check mark or you can click the red x to reset so that you can experiment with other attributes to cluster. If you refresh the page, any unsaved clusters will be removed.
