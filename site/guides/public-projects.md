Public projects are free of charge and always will be. Our vision for public projects is to create a community of people interested in changing the way we approach challenging issues and a space for people to share, build off of, and collaborate on meaningful maps.

## The basics

* Public projects can be viewed by anyone
* You get unlimited collaborators for free (but the owner controls who can edit)
* Others can build off of your work

## Collaborating with others

You can add people as members of your public project just like with private projects. [Click here to learn how.](/basics/sharing-and-collaborating.html)

## Coming soon

We plan to support a wide range of [Github](http://github.com) style features including forking, pull requests, and more. We'll announce via our blog when these features are ready.
