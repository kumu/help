You can create beautiful and engaging network maps with Kumu. Include images of each of the people in your network and size by things like level of influence, net worth and more.

## Creating your map

There are two main ways to create your map.

### Importing from survey data

If you've already created a network survey and have the results, read about how to use [imports](/basics/imports.html) to quickly create your map in Kumu. Kumu offers an easy import format based on two spreadsheets, one for elements (nodes) and one for connections (edges). Even better, you can include attributes on the connections themselves, allowing you to store things like type, strength, and duration.

### Building on the fly

We've made it super easy to build out your map by hand in Kumu. Use the "Add Element" and "Add Connection" buttons and our quick click-to-edit interface on the profile to build out a network map in no time.

## Decorating your map

You can use [perspectives](/guides/perspectives.html) to decorate and filter your map based on the data stored in the profile for any element or connection.

## Social network analysis metrics

We're planning to add support for common network analysis metrics like degree and betweenness centrality soon. Have a specific metric in mind that you'd like to be able to use with Kumu? [Let us know!](mailto:support@kumu.io)

## Directed and undirected connections

By default, Kumu will import your connections as directed but won't display the arrow. To turn the arrow on, select all the connections by using **option** + **a**,click the direction button (<i class="fa fa-random"></i>) in the toolbar and then choose "directed." Connections can be directed, undirected, or mutual (arrows both ways). You also use this button to switch directions for a given directed connection.
